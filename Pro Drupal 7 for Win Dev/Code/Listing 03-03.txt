/**
 * Summary here; one sentence on one line should not exceed 80 chars).
 *
 * A more detailed description goes here.
 *
 * A blank line forms a paragraph. There should be no trailing white-space
 * anywhere.
 *
 * @param $first
 *   "@param" is a Doxygen directive to describe a function parameter. Like some
 *   other directives, it takes a term/summary on the same line and a
 *   description (this text) indented by 2 spaces on the next line. All
 *   descriptive text should wrap at 80 chars, without going over.
 *   Newlines are NOT supported within directives; if a newline would be before
 *   this text, it would be appended to the general description above.
 * @param $second
 *   There should be no newline between multiple directives (of the same type).
 * @param $third
 *   (optional) Boolean whether to do Third. Defaults to FALSE.
 *   Only optional parameters are explicitly stated as such. The description
 *   should clarify the default value if omitted.
 *
 * @return
 *   "@return" is a different Doxygen directive to describe the return value of
 *   a function, if there is any.
